~z~I thought they were sending professionals.
PRCUT_AJAN
11000001100000
PRCUT_AJAO
~z~and making your way into the facility in its place.
PRCUT_AJAZ
PRCUT_AKAN
~z~Good job.
110000011000001100000110000011000001100000
~z~So, Mr Crest said you might be able to help me out with something.
~z~Yeah, okay.
~z~Cool, I'll get set up.
PRCUT_ADAK
~z~Alright, first thing's a plane, then we've got a bus,
~z~Just lawyers. Well, the professor's old business associate and two lawyers,
PRCUT_ADAR
~z~I collaborate and nearly get a shiv for the pleasure.
PRCUT_AJAK
~z~Two of you are going to be taking our prison bus
~z~at the LSPD's Mission Row station.
PRCUT_AJAA
PRCUT_AJBW
~z~Speak soon.

PRCUT_AKBC
~z~Hey, good work people. Great job.
PRCUT_AJBI
PRCUT_AJAM
~z~Oh...
~z~Okay,
~z~I mean, I always say if you can't kill a couple of lawyers to bend the law to your will
~z~I mean he's a rat, but he pays.
~z~So is there a room in the back or something?
110000011000001100000
PRCUT_AJBM
~z~and be waiting on the evac in the air.
~z~One of you is going to intercept the transport, make sure it doesn't get there.
PRCUT_AJAD
PRCUT_ADAE
PRCUT_ADAQ
PRCUT_AJBC
~z~And I want it understood that I am not involved.
~z~Just give me gun.
~z~Hey!
PRCUT_AKAJ
~z~then who can you kill, right?
PRCUT_AGAA
PRCUT_AJAC
PRCUT_AKBD
PRCUT_AJBF
PRCUT_AJBR
~z~Oh, here they are - Gavin Van Der Loop and Josh Sherman.
~z~Whoever stole the bus will be bypassing the prison
100
~z~Anyway, now I'm told they've put a price on the professor's head
~z~Bolingbroke are expecting a new arrival.
~z~we've got to clean up a few other loose ends pertaining to the case.
PRCUT_AJBP
~z~Professor Rashkovsky pays well.
PRCUT_AJBL

490490490
PRCUT_AKAG
~z~Nice...
490490490490490490
PRCUT_ACAC
~z~Cool, I'll get set up.
~z~Well not me, so that's clear, it's not me you're gonna be helping.
~z~I'm usually such a high achiever, you know? For a criminal.
PRCUT_ADAC
~z~It's not paranoia.
PRCUT_AEAA
~z~Yes, it's a killing, but no, it's nothing immoral at all.
PRCUT_ACAB
PRCUT_AJBE
~z~Go in unarmed, play it cool,
PRCUT_AJAT
~z~Meanwhile, the pilot will have picked up the plane
PRCUT_AKAQ
PRCUT_AFAB
~z~Everyone flies out of there except for the bus thief.
~z~we believe it's about to be shipped to Korea by a luxury car theft ring.
~z~so we've gotta move, now.
~z~And remember, the professor is paying you, not me.
PRCUT_AKAS
PRCUT_ADAW
~z~Get them on the way to City Hall, get the documents they're carrying.
~z~Incarcerated for a crime he did commit,
~z~and this is not an offer of employment, so much as an opportunity,
490
PRCUT_AKAO
PRCUT_AKAM
~z~extremely paranoid and extremely horrible.
~z~Some asshole got wind of what we're up to,
PRCUT_ADAS
~z~So, er... Mr Crest said we should talk about er... work,
~z~I'll get on the radio and give you a path to the prof.
~z~apparently killing a guy's closest associate puts a bit of a spotlight on him.
~z~and torching it somewhere discreet.
PRCUT_ADAN
PRCUT_AKAK
~z~and getting him onto the plane.
~z~Just a bystander doing a favor
~z~control freak, geneticist,
PRCUT_AJBG
PRCUT_ADAO
~z~Not me at all.
~z~The business partner is Dima Popov - extremely rich,
110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000
~z~Maybe that's why I'm not the asshole in the jail, huh?

PRCUT_AJBT
PRCUT_AKAD
PRCUT_AKAA
PRCUT_AJBJ
~z~Don't cry for this guy, no one else will.
PRCUT_AJBQ
~z~He's renting a place up in Richman Glen.
~z~God, what is wrong with me, you know?
PRCUT_AFAF
~z~Stay in character as long as it's useful, then make your way to the rooftops,
PRCUT_AKAZ
PRCUT_AJAL
~z~but er... not here.
11000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000110000011000001100000
100
PRCUT_AJBK
PRCUT_AJAB
~z~Is that clear?
PRCUT_AJAU
~z~So long! I hope they pay you good for this!
PRCUT_AKBA
~z~It's being prepared, stupid.
~z~vain sociopath, tedious egomaniac,
PRCUT_AJBZ
~z~but the point is... sometimes our fair and legal justice system makes mistakes,
PRCUT_AHAB
490490490490
PRCUT_AKAX
PRCUT_AJAR
~z~Is there a room in the back or something?
~z~but definitely not a people person.
PRCUT_AJAY
~z~Out!
~z~Just him...
PRCUT_AKAY
~z~Standard OP for a gov fac breakout, if you know what I mean.
~z~You'll be playing inmate and guard.
~z~It's currently being used to traffic drugs by transnational street gang, the Vagos.
PRCUT_AJBO
PRCUT_AFAD
100
~z~Simple, should be the easiest money you'll ever make.
~z~and well... anyway, that's just getting a bit technical,
PRCUT_AKAB
100
PRCUT_ADAP
PRCUT_AJAI
~z~Do them one at a time but any way you like.
~z~We need a plane to get the professor out of the country.
~z~So...
PRCUT_ADAB
PRCUT_AJBD
~z~and a huge security team.
~z~weapons development, engineer, car nut,
~z~I'm taking over.
PRCUT_AJAV
~z~before we remove Professor Rashkovsky from his unwelcome stay in prison we've got to...
PRCUT_AKAE
~z~Professor Rashkovsky takes control of the plane,
PRCUT_AJBB
PRCUT_AJCC
PRCUT_AKAV
~z~So, Mr Crest said we should talk about work...
~z~Can we get going, alright?
~z~You don't remember? Well lucky you.
~z~you might not have a problem. That's a two person job, max.
~z~Get close to him, take him down,
PRCUT_ADAG
~z~Professor Maxim Rashkovsky. You know the professor?
PRCUT_AJBX
~z~Maybe now's not the best time to discuss irony.
PRCUT_AKAU
PRCUT_AJCA
PRCUT_AJAP
PRCUT_AJAQ
490490
~z~So, we've got a few things to get ready, all pretty straight forward.
~z~Let me show you.
~z~but not here.
PRCUT_AJBA
~z~After that, it's just a matter of getting your guy out of the clink
PRCUT_AJAH
~z~and this is one such time. Here he is...
~z~Accused of espionage along with everything else.
~z~The other two-hander is our guy's prized Casco,
PRCUT_ADAZ
PRCUT_AJAJ
490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490
~z~but well, let's just say money talks and he's going to walk.
~z~Nice, we're still in business, very well done.
PRCUT_ADAA
~z~more on that later.
110000011000001100000
PRCUT_AJAW
~z~then... well... two things,
100
~z~Three doctorates, overconfident polymath,
PRCUT_ADAJ
PRCUT_AJBN
~z~You can get a hard copy of the inmate transit schedule
1100000
PRCUT_AIAB
~z~We'll hold onto this for you.
~z~the professor is out of US airspace and reunited with his precious car.
~z~brilliant at everything he does,
PRCUT_AJAS
PRCUT_AKAT
~z~yadda yadda yadda, makes you wanna puke.
~z~All of you, very, very...
PRCUT_AHAA
100
~z~Based on this inmate transfer schedule,
PRCUT_AFAE
490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490490
PRCUT_ACAA
PRCUT_AKAC
~z~and after that we should be ready to go.
PRCUT_AJCB
~z~That's where you're gonna be able to get hold of one.
~z~Exceedingly vain and self-absorbed man,
PRCUT_ADAY
PRCUT_AJAX
PRCUT_ADAL
PRCUT_AHAC
~z~We'll take care of this.
PRCUT_AKAF
~z~There are some screws I hope we run into.
PRCUT_ADAT
PRCUT_AIAD
~z~Used to be head of research for the army.
~z~He's a Goddamn traitor.
PRCUT_AEAB
PRCUT_AJBS
PRCUT_ADAD
~z~So keep him alive.
PRCUT_AKAP
~z~non-incriminating. Yes, that's the word I'm looking for.
100
~z~Rad...
PRCUT_ADAH
PRCUT_AJAG
PRCUT_ADAF
~z~Let's go!
~z~the least traffic is on the route from Paleto Bay, alright?
PRCUT_AKAH
PRCUT_ADAX
~z~Ah, you know it's ironic given we er, er....
PRCUT_ADAM
~z~Mr Crest said you guys were at least semi-competent, so well...
PRCUT_AKBB
~z~the three of you onboard take a jump,
~z~we've got the inmate transfer schedule and Rashkovsky's car,
PRCUT_AKAW
~z~but really it's all the same.
100
~z~The bus... we need a standard Bolingbroke transport vehicle,
~z~Nice.
PRCUT_ADAI
PRCUT_AIAA
~z~We've got a bit of a problem.
PRCUT_ADAU
